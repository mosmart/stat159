# Conclusion

Writing a reproducible paper isn't as easy as it seems. If people don't keep track of their files in an easily accessible way, with good labeling, and version control, telling someone how to reproduce their works exactly will be nearly impossible. If one uses markdown to keep the content of his or her files organized and clean, Git to track the versions of those files, GitHub to store the files in a cloud to be accessed by others, pandoc to automate the file type conversion, and finally Makefile to automate all file concatenation and file type conversion to generate the final output paper, that process of creating that final output paper will have been fully automated. Thus, the final paper will be reproducible once anyone clones the GitHub repository storing all of the files used to generate the final output paper.
