# Simple Linear Regression

### Author:

## Goal:

Replicate the report output from hw2 using .Rnw file to learn how to write using LaTex. To do this, I copied the necessary dependencies of the hw2 report to this lab9 folder, saved the old `report.R` from hw2 as `lab9.Rnw` and edited it to be in LaTex format, and finally I compiled this .Rnw file to a PDF. I also included a .gitignore file to hide the many outputs from the PDF compiler that I didn't' want displayed.
